## ⚠️ Common Interview Traps

<Callout type="warn" title="Avoid These Mistakes">
- Memorizing answers without understanding **why**
- Ignoring internal working of collections

## 🚀 How to Use This Section Effectively

<Callout type="success">
✔ Read concept → ✔ Write code → ✔ Break it → ✔ Fix it → ✔ Explain it aloud  
That’s how interviewers think.

## 🎯 Final Advice

<Callout type="info">
Java interviews are not about **syntax** —  
they are about **thinking, trade-offs, and real-world decisions**.
