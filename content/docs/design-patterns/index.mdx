title: Design Patterns
description: Design patterns are Reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They are proven techniques that experienced developers use to build flexible, maintainable, and scalable code. Think of them as blueprints or templates for solving recurring design problems.

## Why Learn Design Patterns?

✅ **Write Better Code** — Create code that's clean, understandable, and follows best practices  
✅ **Solve Problems Faster** — Use proven solutions instead of reinventing the wheel  
✅ **Communicate Better** — Use a common vocabulary with other developers  
✅ **Build Maintainable Systems** — Code that's easier to extend and modify over time  
✅ **Ace Job Interviews** — Essential knowledge for senior developer roles

## The Three Categories (23 Gang of Four Patterns)

Design patterns are organized into three main categories based on their purpose:

### 🏗️ [Creational Patterns](/docs/design-patterns/creational) — How to Create Objects
Focus on **object creation mechanisms**. They provide flexible ways to instantiate objects without specifying exact classes.

**Patterns:** Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype  
**Best for:** Complex initialization, managing object creation, ensuring single instances

### 🔄 [Behavioral Patterns](/docs/design-patterns/behavioral) — How Objects Communicate
Focus on **communication between objects** and distribution of responsibility. They define how objects interact and work together.

**Patterns:** Observer, Strategy, State, Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Mediator, Memento, Template Method, Visitor  
**Best for:** Defining object interactions, managing state changes, handling complex workflows

### 🔗 [Structural Patterns](/docs/design-patterns/structural) — How to Compose Objects
Focus on **object composition** and relationships. They help you organize objects into larger structures while maintaining flexibility.

**Patterns:** Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy  
**Best for:** Building relationships between objects, adding functionality, simplifying complex systems

## Quick Reference: When to Use Each Pattern

| Problem | Solution | Pattern |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Need only one instance of a class | Restrict instantiation | **Singleton** |
| Multiple ways to create an object | Abstract creation logic | **Factory / Abstract Factory** |
| Complex object with many options | Build step-by-step | **Builder** |
| Clone existing objects | Copy prototype | **Prototype** |
| Notify multiple objects of changes | One-to-many relationship | **Observer** |
| Multiple algorithms for same task | Switch at runtime | **Strategy** |
| Change behavior based on state | Encapsulate state logic | **State** |
| Pass requests through handlers | Chain of responsibility | **Chain of Responsibility** |
| Undo/Redo functionality | Save state snapshots | **Memento** |
| Make incompatible classes work together | Convert interface | **Adapter** |
| Organize hierarchical structures | Tree representation | **Composite** |
| Add features dynamically | Wrap with decorators | **Decorator** |
| Simplify complex subsystems | Single unified interface | **Facade** |
| Support millions of small objects | Share common state | **Flyweight** |
| Control access to another object | Intermediary object | **Proxy** |

## Pro Tips for Learning

💡 **Don't memorize** — Focus on understanding the problem it solves  
💡 **Combine patterns** — Real systems often use multiple patterns together  
💡 **Start simple** — Only use patterns when you actually need them  
💡 **Refactor toward patterns** — Discover patterns through refactoring, don't force them  
💡 **Understand trade-offs** — Every pattern has pros and cons
